## Generic calendar

### Number of days by period

In its computation of trading days regressors, JD+ first computes the number of days for each period.

The different periods can be defined by grouping the days 

#### All days separately

```{r}
rjd3modelling::td(12, c(2022,1), 24, contrasts = F)

```
#### Week days, Saturdays and Sundays

```{r}
rjd3modelling::td(12, c(2022,1), 24, groups=c(1,1,1,1,1,2,0), contrasts = F)

```
